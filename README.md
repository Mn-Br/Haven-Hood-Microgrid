# Haven-Hood-Microgrid
This project is about establishing a microgrid power system for a special container-based refugee camp that operates mainly by renewable energy, specifically solar energy. Additionally, calculating all the loads that can be consumed in this city, such as homes, schools, hospitals, and others. The outcome is a design of an electrical plan by ETAP & PVsyst.
