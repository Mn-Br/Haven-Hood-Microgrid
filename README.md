# Haven-Hood-Microgrid
This project is about establishing an off-grid microgrid power system for a special container-based refugee camp that operates mainly by renewable energy, specifically solar energy; a stand-alone solar system. Additionally, calculating and representing all the loads that can be consumed in this city, such as homes, schools, hospitals, and others. The outcome is a design of an electrical plan by ETAP & PVsyst.
